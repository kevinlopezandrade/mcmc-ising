# MCMC, Ising Model & TSP

This repo contains implementations of various MCMC sampling procedures.
As well as an implementation of simmulated annealing in order to approximate
a local minima in the traveling salesman problem. A implementation of the ising
model to perform noise reduction is also provided.
